# Project 3 Backend

## Technology Used

Express, Mongoose, CORS

## Issues

No real issues of note with making the backend, it's pretty simple all town

## Division of Work

The main plan was for me to do the back end, and Youssef to do the front end. I didn't realize the division of labor was so uneven. And then most of my time was spent trying to figure out queries and filtering, along with trying to figure out deploying to Heroku. Back end was easy enough, front end was like driving an ice pick through my skull. I've learned a lot from this however, and will do better in the future
